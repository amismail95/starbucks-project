#Installation
Python 3 should run the code with no problems. No libraries are necessary beyoed the Anaconda distribution of Python.

#Project Motivation
I wanted to better understand the NBA shot behavior, and specifically these questions:

How does the shooting behavior differ when playing at home vs. away?
Is height an advantage when taking a shot?
What factors are important to make good shots?

#File Descriptions
There are two notebooks here. The first one is just preparaing the data. The second one includes the analysis and modeling.

#Results
This post includes the results of this analysis.

#Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgments
I would like to thank William Luce for providing the data for player heights and uploading it to Kaggle.
