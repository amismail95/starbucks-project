Installation
============
Python 3 should run the code with no problems. No libraries are necessary beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.

Project Motivation
============
I wanted to use machine learning to improve Starbucks Rewards Program, and specifically answer these questions:

1. Could we predict whether a member would be completing the offers sent to him/her based solely on the demographics of that member?
2. Could we predict the time a member would take to complete the offer?
3. Could we predict whether a member would complete the offer based on demographics AND the offer type?

File Descriptions
============
There is one notebook here with all the work as well as the files for the data used in the project.

Results
============
1. Predicting offer completion based on demographics only yielded poor to fair results.
2. Predicting the time a member would take to complete an offer was difficult but yielded sensible results.
3. Predicting offer completion based on demographics and offer type yielded good results. 

This [post](https://medium.com/@amismail95/improving-starbucks-rewards-program-through-machine-learning-7d1f34849f9b) includes detailed results of this analysis.

Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgments
============
I would like to thank Udacity for providing the project as well as the data.
